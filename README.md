## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Serial Communication Module:**
   - Handles the serial connection between the application and the UHF RFID reader.
   - Manages command sending and response reading, ensuring reliable communication.

2. **Command Parser:**
   - Parses the commands sent to the UHF reader and interprets the responses.
   - Provides error handling and retries for robust operation.

3. **UHF Control Interface:**
   - Offers high-level methods to control UHF reader functionalities, such as setting power levels, adjusting ping rates, and reading tags.

4. **Multi-Language Support:**
   - Provides language-specific bindings for easy integration across Java, Go, JS, C#, Python, and PHP.

### Standards and Best Practices

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Ensures that the library can be used across different operating systems and development environments.
- **Code Quality:** Adheres to industry standards for readability, maintainability, and extensibility.
- **Error Handling:** Implements robust error handling and retry mechanisms to deal with communication failures.
- **Security:** Ensures secure communication with the UHF reader by validating all input data and controlling access to the reader.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Single Scan (First Object)

```python
from uhflib import UHFReader

reader = UHFReader('COM4', 115200)
reader.connect()
tag_data = reader.read_tag()
print(f"First Tag Data: {tag_data}")
reader.disconnect()
```

**Explanation:** This example demonstrates how to perform a single scan to retrieve the first detected RFID tag's data.

### Example 2: Continuous Scanning (Multiple Objects, Remove Duplicates)

```python
import time
from uhflib import UHFReader

reader = UHFReader('COM4', 115200)
reader.connect()

seen_tags = set()

try:
    while True:
        tag_data = reader.read_tag()
        if tag_data and tag_data not in seen_tags:
            print(f"New Tag Detected: {tag_data}")
            seen_tags.add(tag_data)
        time.sleep(0.1)  # Adjust the scan rate as needed
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Stopping continuous scan.")
finally:
    reader.disconnect()
```

**Explanation:** This example continuously scans for RFID tags, removing duplicates and showing a list of unique tags in real-time.

### Example 3: Controlling UHF Intensity (Adjusting dBm)

```python
from uhflib import UHFReader

reader = UHFReader('COM4', 115200)
reader.connect()

# Set the UHF reader power level to 30 dBm
reader.set_power_level(30)

# Perform a scan to see how the power adjustment affects detection
tag_data = reader.read_tag()
print(f"Tag Data with 30 dBm: {tag_data}")

reader.disconnect()
```

**Explanation:** This example demonstrates how to control the power output of the UHF reader by adjusting the dBm level, which can help in controlling the read range and intensity.

### Example 4: Controlling Ping Rate (Adjusting Scan Interval)

```python
from uhflib import UHFReader

reader = UHFReader('COM4', 115200)
reader.connect()

# Set the ping rate to 5 seconds
reader.set_ping_rate(5000)  # 5000 milliseconds

# Perform scanning with the new ping rate
while True:
    tag_data = reader.read_tag()
    if tag_data:
        print(f"Tag Data: {tag_data}")
    time.sleep(5)

reader.disconnect()
```

**Explanation:** This example shows how to control the ping rate of the UHF reader, setting it to scan every 5 seconds.
